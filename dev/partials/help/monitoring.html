Steps for implementing and using a monitoring system

1. IDENTIFYING NEEDS (I.E., THE INFORMATION BEING SOUGHT)
Review each indicator selected for the reference project (logical framework) and evaluate its relevance, modifying it as necessary depending on the need for information by various partners and by MdM. 

2. DEVELOPING THE MONITORING SYSTEM
A. Selecting relevant indicators

a) NHIS
The goal of most MdM projects is to support and reinforce health systems. Therefore, MdM prefers to use existing information systems whenever possible (use the National Health Information System (NHIS) whenever possible). You should start with the nationally-defined and -accepted indicators. The advantage of this is two-fold:
–        reinforcement of the existing system, avoiding implementation of a parallel system 
–        the source will be easier to identify.

b) S2AP Catalogs
S2AP catalogs are useful for providing definitions of indicators and showing how to calculate them and how they can be used to make decisions. These catalogs, especially the 'comments' columns with useful notes on the suitability of each indicator, can:
1) be used in conjunction with NHIS indicators to help in decision-making
2) fill any gaps in the NHIS.

c) Other
Other sources may also be used in combination with the ones mentioned above, especially when information needed is not in the NHIS (for example, mental health). You may also use international reference documents such as WHO guides. The S2AP library is an excellent way to access the reference documents:

It is important to limit the number of indicators chosen: 
-          to fill in an indicator, you must often gather information on numerous other variables
-          any indicator chosen must be analyzed periodically (weekly, monthly, annually, etc.). An indicator is filled in not for the sake of knowledge, but for the sake of action.


B. Filling out the Monitool
This task of defining and clarifying roles and responsibilities should be performed as a team.

1) Completing the “Indicators Summary”

a) WHAT
This column is for the ordinary heading for the indicator selected. 

b) HOW MUCH: Baselines, benchmarks and targets
Some indicators have international standards indicating the level to be achieved (benchmark). This provides orders of magnitude for trends, allows users to better interpret available data and aids in planning corrective action if necessary. 

However, these standards should be translated into a target appropriate for the project (target): standards must be tailored based on the current situation in the area of operation (baseline) and on what can reasonably be expected from MdM interventions. It is often better to consult national standards, which take into account a country's issues.

c) WHEN: Frequency of collection
Determine the frequency of collection taking into consideration the human and material resources necessary for data collection and analysis. 

d) HOW: Calculating the indicator
Specify the method for calculating the indicator. This is an important step because NHIS and international methods may sometimes differ.

e) WHERE: Sources of verification
When identifying sources of verification (support for collection), be as specific as possible: e.g. which form contains the information?

If they don't exist already, registers, tracking sheets, computer media, etc. should be set up insofar as possible before starting any activities, if not at the very beginning of the project. The structure of these tools should be decided ahead of time and should not change too often; otherwise, information will not be able to be compared later. 

f) WHO
Choose one person responsible for collection and one person responsible for analysis of each indicator (this is usually not the same person). 

g) WHY
What will the indicator tell us and what will this indicator be useful for?

h) For WHOM
Who are we collecting this indicator for (who is our target)? Who will we communicate the progress of this indicator to?


2) Completing the monitoring plan
The monitoring plan contains the indicators of the “Indicators Summary” and shows their progress towards the target set at the beginning. 
It includes:
–        the indicators;
–        the baseline data and corresponding targets;
–        the monthly or weekly value (depending on the frequency of collection) achieved by each indicator at time t;
–        a graph showing progress towards the target;
–        notes on the graph.

3) Providing supporting material for data collection

Once the indicators have been defined, the supporting material must be created for collecting quality data. 

Note: It is strongly recommended to use data collection methods that already exist in the country of operation when possible. It is better to reinforce existing systems (even when they are mediocre or incomplete) than to implement parallel data collection systems. This helps avoid increasing the workload of healthcare workers. Exceptions can be made when MdM wants to document specific health issues that are not routinely documented by NHIS, for example, mental health, gender-related violence, etc.

It is important to take the time to develop the data collection forms and files properly and to train (MdM or partner organization) employees who will be collecting the data. It is important to include those participating in the data collection (MdM and health centre employees, data clerks, etc.) when developing tools and determining the collection methods. 


3. PERFORMING THE DATA COLLECTION
A. Choosing a data collection method
There are various confirmation sources and methods for filling in the indicators selected, depending on the type of information being sought: 

1.      Routine information systems: The National Health Information System (NHIS) and/or the Healthcare Facility Health Information System (SIS) provide access to healthcare service statistics, epidemiological data and administrative and financial data for a specific administrative region (nation, district, community). 

2.      Cross-sectional surveys on healthcare services — for example, to gauge the level of patient satisfaction or the skill level of health professionals — may be given periodically during supervisory visits. The surveys combine several methods: observation of a sample of medical procedures, case studies, interviews with healthcare providers, interviews with patients after a doctor's visit. 

3.      Population surveys or surveys of a representative sample of households (e.g. a "KAP" survey) require large investments of time, money, logistics and technical skill. This type of survey should therefore be used sparingly and as a last resort. However, the results of DHS (Demographic and Health Survey) or MICS (Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey) population surveys should be acquired and used; these surveys are conducted regularly in most of the countries of operation. These surveys include both national and rural data and can provide a great deal of useful information.


B. Protecting sensitive data

4. COMPILING AND PRESENTING DATA
A.  Entering and verifying data (data cleaning)
The field team is responsible for organizing data collection. It is important to verify and confirm data collected. It is the responsibility of a person specifically designated for that, other than the data entry clerk. This third party reviews the data, identifies data entry errors and verifies missing and outlying data. Once the data has been verified and confirmed, it is saved and retained for analysis.

Examples of anomalous data:
–        an age of 250;
–        a confirmed abortion, even though data shows that the person has never been pregnant;
–        a place to acquire injectable drugs is specified, even though data shows the person says they have never taken drugs.

Mistakes may arise during collection; in this case, go back to the forms to rectify the errors.

B. Presenting data
There are many ways to present information to facilitate analysis and communicate results. Different types of graphs are used for very specific situations. Each graph has distinctive features that must be understood in order to decide what type of graph is most appropriate for presenting a particular type of information. Choose the most appropriate graph based on the nature of the data and the indicators selected. Write a short description highlighting the most important results.


5. ANALYSING AND INTERPRETING THE DATA
Significant effort is put into collecting and compiling large amounts of useful data on projects, but the amount of time needed to sort and analyze the data is all too often given short shrift or wholly neglected. It is essential for data to be analysed so that adequate project management decisions can be made. It is therefore necessary to set aside a certain amount of time for reflection and analysis (for example, during quarterly project reviews) to study, test and confirm hypotheses.

Any piece of information collected but not analyzed is a waste of time and energy. 
Any collected indicator should be accompanied by an explanatory paragraph. 

The monitoring plan provides incomplete but useful indications and information that should be analysed/interpreted. The numbers themselves mean nothing. The numbers collected are compared with targets/benchmarks/baselines. They must then be interpreted in light of other information available on the project and the context. They must be put in context and explained. 

Information has no meaning if we cannot compare it to other information as a point of reference. This comparison can be made over a given space or time. Static data provides a snapshot of a situation at a given moment in time. It is important to take into account trends observed over time. At the very least, trends (changes in relation to the baseline, changes in relation to targets and/or benchmarks, comparisons between different groups, etc.) should be studied.

This analysis should be performed as team, involving all members of the project team. Their knowledge of the context results in a more thorough and precise analysis of the data. Teamwork also increases involvement of team members with the project and helps motivate them.

A. Comparing over time
Information collected is not useful unless it is compared to information from previous measurements (trends analysis). 
Caution: The quality of data collection may also vary over time. Therefore, an increase in the infant mortality rate due to malaria in a particular region may reflect: better data collection; an actual difference.

Before drawing the conclusion that there is an actual difference between two situations and diving headlong into an investigation for the causes, first check for any changes that may have been made to data collection methods.

B. Comparing over space
In the initial description of a country's or region's situation, it is useful to be able to compare available data to data from other countries or regions (climate, seasons, GDP, etc.). For instance, workers can compare the incidence rate of AIDS between drug users in France and England, or between Ukraine and Russia. 

Caution: The quality of data collection can vary greatly from one country to another. Also, different calculation methods may be used to arrive at these indicators. For example, the method for calculating the unemployment rate is the not same in France as in the United States. Make sure to verify the calculation methods. 

Text box: Population-based vs. service-based
For the denominator, pay particular attention to the reference population: 
-          target population (population-based); or 
-          service users (service-based). 

Indicators calculated on the basis of population data provide information on:
a)      the effects of projects on the target population's state of health, whether or not they seek healthcare services, for example, the maternal mortality rate;
b)      coverage of services offered to the target population, for example, the coverage rate for complete prenatal care.

Doing this requires reliable demographic data on the target population. This can sometimes be difficult to obtain in developing countries and may require using estimates, which may be inaccurate. When data are incorrect, they may show a service coverage rate of over 100% and are therefore completely unusable. 

To make up for an information gap due to a lack of demographic data, especially on a target population's mortality or morbidity rate, it may be decided to resort to indicators calculated on the basis of data from healthcare service users. This provides partial information on a population's state of health and on health system operations in a project's region of operation. The main disadvantage of data from healthcare services is the selection bias by the population using these services. A significant portion of the target population does not use these services, and often the people using the services are those who have an easier time obtaining access to healthcare. In this case, the selection bias may favour those who live the closest, for example.

Indicators calculated on the basis of data from healthcare services help measure coverage and quality of services offered to people who use these services, and only those people. One example is the coverage of syphilis screening for pregnant women receiving prenatal care. 

6. ENSURING FEEDBACK AND DISSEMINATION OF DATA
Conclusions or observations drawn from data analyses must be subjected to feedback to teams and partners. This is essential for creating a change in practices and motivating teams. It can be done biannually or quarterly in the form of a meeting with the entire team, with a presentation of the graphs and charts and a reminder of the target.


7. USING DATA
Once data has been collected, compiled and analyzed, it must be used and translated into various actions.

A. Managing and adjusting the project
Inevitably, when implementing a project, adjustments must be made to the organization of activities based on new information or data collected.

Once information collected has been analyzed, it can be used to help identify what works and what doesn't, which intended activities have been implemented and which have been set aside, etc.
Adjustments should be made based on information provided by the data analysis. If, for example, an intended activity within the overall project does not seem to be developing/progressing according to the plan in the Gantt chart, find out why and how to remedy it. Likewise, if it comes to light that an implemented activity is not producing the expected results (for example, no one visits the new clinic), analyze why it's not working (e.g., the clinic is in an area that is not accessible, the population has not been informed that a new clinic is open, etc.) and take actions to make it work, or even change the activity.

B. Communicating, advocating
Data provide information and reflect the results of actions that have been implemented. It is therefore essential to always share observations and conclusions drawn from their analysis with all MdM partners (project team, institutional partners, partner associations, donors, etc.). When adjustments are necessary, the reasons for them should be explained clearly.

Data are the basis of any advocacy action. Our advocacy actions to political decision-makers, the media, our partners, the general population, etc. should be based on solid and meaningful information.
